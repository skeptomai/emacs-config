p((<>[11](my_class). This is a Textile test.

h1. This is a first-level header.

(list1)#(#listid1) This is the first entry in my ordered list[1].
#(listclass2) This is the second.

# This should be the first entry in a new ordered list.
# This should be the second.
(#unordered)** The third entry is a nested list.
** See how I just mix and match lists?
**{color: red} This is supposed to be a v2 feature.
# And this should be the third.

* This is a single-item unordered list.

* What if a list
* of some length
* has a line
which starts with no list item tag
* and yet finishes with one?

h2. Textile lisp evaluation:

This is #[((textile-version t))]# running on #[((car (textile-split-string (emacs-version) "\n")))]# if you were curious.

What about @#@@[((textile-version t))]#@?

h2. Textile smart quotes tests:

""This is a link.":http://www.livingtorah.org"

This is a ".emacs" file.

Blocks that "end in quotes seem to work right."

"'He said,' she said, 'that quotes within quotes are fairly common.'"

"'"And what," he said,' she said, 'about when he said, "about what she said?"'"

She paused, "...I don't think I understand."

What if we have quotes darting in and out of inline tags?  _Custer_'s last stand?  What about _Custer's_ last stand?

"_Groovy._"

Don't look now, but here come the '80s.

h2. Textile v1 image tests:

!http://www.livingtorah.org/images/a.gif!

Here is !http://www.livingtorah.org/images/a.gif (an inline image)! to see if that works.

And finally, here is !http://a.com/b.gif (a normal image)! and !http://a.com/c.gif (a linked image)!:ltm which is linked to an alias, no less.

h2. Textile v2 image tests:

!http://a.com/b.gif 30x40!

!http://a.com/b.gif 30w 40h!

!)>http://a.com/b.gif!

!{border: 0px}http://a.com/b.gif 30x40 (with a title)!

!{border: 0px}http://a.com/b.gif 30x40 (with a title)!:ltm

Can an _image be !http://a.com/b.gif (surrounded by tags)! without_ breaking?

h2. Textile link tests:

See http://www.livingtorah.org for a normal inline link without any special text.

OK, "here is a link":http://www.livingtorah.org to my website.

"Here is a link":http://www.livingtorah.org, and "here's another":http://www.livingtorah.org.

Let's try aliases: "here":ltm is the ministry link, and "here":ltj is the journal.

And then "a normal link (Sun)":http://www.sun.com to Sun's website.

And a "link including an ampersand":http://www.example.com/cgi-bin/test?a=b&c=d, which would also be a good way to see if the URL-finding code knows where to stop.

We alternate between TLA(Three Letter Acronym) and TLA in this paragraph.

Will thís be cônverted to Unicode, or at least entities?

Here are the inline tests: We have a *strong* and an _emphasized,_ a **bold,** an __italics,__ a ++bigger,++ a --smaller,-- something -deleted,- something +inserted,+ some ^superscript,^ some ~subscript,~ a %{color: red}red span,% and @some code, including something like 2>&1 and _non-emphasized text_.@  And here's some ==*escaped text*== just to see what happens.  Here's some ??cited text?? also.

Now, strong*things*embedded shouldn't work, but strong[*things embedded in braces*]should work.

What about _emphasized text with some *strong* text within it?_

*_And what about something right at the beginning of a line?_*  Hm, what about that?  This isn't a list item, is it?

And let's not forget that we should be able to _(emphasize things in parentheses without it trying to turn that into a style)._

p)>. This should be a paragraph, floated right and padded on the right by 1 em.

bq. This is a blockquote.
I am going to cut it into small lines
With their own line breaks.

clear.

dl. term:definition
block:not usually something like this,
and here's a line break to make things really interesting
term with spaces:the definition should be self-evident
finally:a last definition to see if it works

|This is a simple table.|
>|Here is a cell that
has a newline character in it.  Yikes.|
|I hope that this works.|

table(#table1). _|row 1, col 1|row 1, col 2|
|\2. row 2, cols 1-2|
|/2. rows 3-4, col 1|row 3, col 2|
|row 4, col 2|
|^. row 5, col 1|~. row5, col 2|

table(tbl1). (head)|_. column 1 |_.      column 2 |_>.     column 3 |
                   |   1        |        2        |(test).        3 |
                   |   4        |(#foo). 5        |               6 |
                   |   7        |        8        |(test#bar).    9 |

bc.. This is code
  Which you can see is a little bit
    indented and tells us that 2>1
      And that 1 & 2 < 4 but I'm going to hardcode an &amp; in here.
    Do you think this will work?

  Look, more indented code!
    It's supposed to stop before the next escape block.

==
<p>This is supposed to be escaped text.  I should be able to do [1] in here with no problems, as well as other weird things.</p>

bq. Like this.

h3. Or this.
==

h3))>. This is a third-level header.

1. And this is just a paragraph that starts with a number, perhaps in an ill-advised attempt to begin a list?

h7. This is a mistake[42].

bq>.. And here is a lengthier piece that actually contains what we would think of as an extended block.

This is also covered as part of the previous extended block.

p. And this is a normal paragraph again.

fn1. This is my first footnote.

fn42. This is my forty-second.

bc. Here's some code
written at the very end, because
that seems to be failing at the moment

What about code here?
